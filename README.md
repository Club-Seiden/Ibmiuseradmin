Introduction
------------

ZfcUser is a user registration and authentication module for Zend Framework 2.
Out of the box, ZfcUser works with Zend\Db, however alternative storage adapter
modules are available (see below). ZfcUser provides the foundations for adding
user authentication and registration to your ZF2 site. It is designed to be very
simple and easily to extend.
